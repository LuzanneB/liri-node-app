# Liri Bot
## She'll Do What You Say! 

Liri Bot is a simple program that reaches out to a different API and returns results based on the command.

### movieThis  

In order to grab information about a movie, I've set up Liri to search OMDB API for a movie and return Title, Release Year, IMDB Rating, Rotten Tomatoes Rating, Production Country, Language, Actors and Plot.  To search for a movie, type "movieThis" followed by the title of the movie you wish to find.  If no movie is inputed, the command will return information for the movie, "Mr.Nobody".

### spotifyThisSong  

In order to grab information about a song, I've set up Liri to search Spotify API for a song title and return Artist Name, Song Name, a Link to a preview song, and album name.  To search for a song, type "spotifyThisSong" followed by the title of the song you wish to find.  If no song is inputed, the command will return information for the song, "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

### concertThis  

In order to grab information about the next concert being held by an artist, I've set up Liri to search BandsInTown API for an artist and return Venue, City and Event Date.  To search for a concert, type "concertThis" followed by the title of the artist whose concert you wish to find.  

### doWhatItSays

This command will pull a command and input from the random.txt file and run it accordingly.
